### 👋 Hi, I’m Michael D. Johnston aka @SciFan-San
I'm a Full-stack Web Developer in the making. Currently my practice and study is very focused on the frond-end of web development. My goal is to eventually become a backend ninja though!

### 👀 I’m interested in:
Tabletop Roleplaying games, like Dungeons and Dragons and other things like it, mostly playing but also running games. And other geeky things like Anime, Videogames and the like. I also like reading quite a bit and my favourite genres are Sci-Fi and Fantasy (original i know! 😜). My favourite is the combination of the gnres though, like Star Wars 😉. 

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- JavaScript & Git, 
- Then Python and PHP
- And finally mySQL, then postgreSQL
- Will also be doing learning Reacty an TypeScript and the NEXTjs on the side.

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open Source projects like forks of valve's proton compatibility layer ('cause I'm a gamer and Linux fanboy 😄)
- Linux OS contribtions eventually after I pick up more computer science knowledge and programming experience - Rust and C here I come? 😅.
